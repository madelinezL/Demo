This Life Science Accounts Scan project is a Deloitte Firm Initiative project which I enrolled starting from May 2023. 

## Project Background
The Finance and Enterprise Performance (F&EP) team is executing a scan of finance functions across the life science sector to gather centralized data that is comprehensive, relevant, and transparent. Through the survey and dashboard, the team aims to extract current quantitative and qualitative metrics from life science account leaders and aggregate the centralized data to provide Partners, Principals, Managing Directors (PPMDs) with the ability to monitor and track account performance in comparision to industry standards.

The team will provide solutions across from the below four major parameters at an account and industry level. 

1. Strategy: Enterprise-level qualitative data points that reveal the current and future strategic actions of the business
2. People: Targeted people metrics that provide meaningful insights into overall talent, global business serivce functions, and level of centralization within each business process area
3. Process: Standard operational metrics that provide high level insights into each business process area as well as current levels of automation reliance
4. Technology: Tech-enabled insights that provide an overview of the systems and tools currently utilized within the business

## Responsibilities and Contributions
I have been assisting in building executive level dashboards for Process parameter based off of the collected survey data. I utilize Tableau to create appropriate visualizations that effectively represent key metrics and insights, design the layout and structure of the dashboards to ensure a logical flow of the information and easy navigation, and collaborate with the team in charge of other parameters to monitor and evaluate the dashboards' effectiveness, incorporate feedbacks and make improvements as needed.
