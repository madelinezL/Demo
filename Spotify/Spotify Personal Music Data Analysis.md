The Spotify Personal Music Data Analysis is an individual project I did in July, 2022. <br/><br/>
I used data visualizations (i.e. ggplot2) to analyze my music taste and preference. 
Also, I built prediction models (i.e. linear regression model, stepwise forward model, tree model) and found the one with the best performance to predict the streaming time of a track based on its audio features.
