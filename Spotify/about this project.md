One of my hobbies is binging on music. As an active subscriber of Spotify, I beat 94% of the subscribers in 2022 in terms of streaming.

The Spotify Personal Music Data Analysis is an individual project I did in July, 2022. <br/><br/>
I used data visualizations (i.e. ggplot2) to analyze my music taste and preference. <br/>
Also, I built prediction models (i.e. linear regression model, stepwise forward model, tree model) and found the one with the best performance to predict the streaming time of a track based on its audio features.

Another machine learning paper I did in April, 2023 is to conduct a comparative study of Support Vector Regression and Feedforward Neural Network on Spotify Recommendation System.
