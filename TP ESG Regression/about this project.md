This Transfer Pricing Ecnometric Analysis - ESG Activities On Profitability project is a Deloitte TP internal project which I participated in July 2023.

## Project Backgroud
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by making medical diagnosis faster and more accurate, improving patient outcomes, and reducing costs. However, the successful implementation of AI in healthcare relies on the consolidation of relevant data into an analytics friendly platform. Unfortuantely, most of the data required to perform meaningful analyses is often trapped inside various schemas and data stores. To address this issue, the Health Analytics Platform - Artificial Intelligence (HAP.ai) is designed to handle the complexities of healthcare data integration. By seamlessly connecting disparate data sources and schemas, HAP.ai enables healthcare providers to unlock valuable insights and harness the power of AI for informed decision-making.
