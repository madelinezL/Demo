This Transfer Pricing ("TP") Econometric Analysis of ESG Benefit project is a Deloitte TP internal project which I participated in July 2023. 

## Backgroud
Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") is a mechanism to transparently and consistently communicate how organizations are operationalizing their sustainability agenda. It reflects the broad set of environmental and societal risks, opportunities, and disruptors that an organization manages, measures, and credibly communicates its performance. ESG value creation offers numerous benefits to companies, society, and the environment. By integrating sustainable practices and responsible business strategies, companies can unlock a host of benefits, including top-line growth, cost reductions, productivity uplift, risk mitigation, regulatory relief, and investment and innovation.

Deloitte transfer pricing team has conducted an econometric analysis to measure the benefit provided by ESG activities for transfer pricing purposes. The analysis can be used to determine arm’s length prices for ESG benefit between intercompany affiliates of a company.  

## Data Preparartion
Obtained from Refinitive, the preliminary dataset consists of 339 companies across three regions including Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia Pacific (“APAC”) and North America. The dataset period spans from 2016 to 2021 and includes data from 20 countries, such as France, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Japan, China, United States, and Canada.
