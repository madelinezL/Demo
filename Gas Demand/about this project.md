The National Gas Demand Prediction is an individual project I did in May, 2020.

I sourced raw data from official websites and sorted the data into a matrix. Then I built a vector auto regression model, smoothed average model, log-linear regression model and performed the multivariate time series analysis. Based on the results, I predicted natural gas demand for the next 10 years and propose potential solutions to policy makers.
